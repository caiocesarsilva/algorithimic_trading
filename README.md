# algorithimic_trading
This repository is dedicated to learning and implementing algorithmic trading strategies using Python.
Here, we explore the foundations of algorithmic trading, from setting up a proper development environment to designing and backtesting trading strategies. Key topics include:

  *Core components of an algorithmic trading system
  *Development of quantitative trading signals
  *Implementation of well-known and advanced strategies (volatility-based, economic event-driven, statistical arbitrage, etc.)
  *Building and optimizing a trading bot

The goal is to provide hands-on experience in researching, evaluating, and safely deploying algorithmic strategies in live markets. Whether you're learning the basics or refining sophisticated models, this repository serves as a practical guide to modern electronic trading.
